# About

Gvbvdxx Game Maker 3 is inspired by [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu) and the [TurboWarp](https://turbowarp.org) (mod & mods), just like its previous versions.

It's optimized to export and work on mobile better, because the games can control which resources are loaded and which ones are not, and it's a lot easier to make games because of it's scratch-like interface.
